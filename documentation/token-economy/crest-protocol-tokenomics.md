It will encompass not only Cpt tokens but also other assets such as ZETA Holdings and more as our operations progress. Oversight and management of the Treasury will be handled by CRESTDao through the ZETA Gnosis wallet. The wallet address for the Treasury will be openly accessible for transparency.
