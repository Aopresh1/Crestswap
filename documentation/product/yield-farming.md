# ðŸšœ Yield Farming

### Yield Farming:

Through CrestSwap Yield Farms, users can stake Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens to enhance earning potential with native token rewards.

Yield Farms enable users to earn CPT while contributing to CrestSwap by staking LP Tokens.

### Understanding Yield Farming:

Yield Farming involves leveraging Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols to generate interest on Cryptocurrency Assets. It encompasses various methods such as Providing Liquidity, Staking, or Lending, each requiring different considerations before participation. Here, we'll focus on Yield Farming through Providing Liquidity.

### How Yield Farms Operate:

CrestSwap Yield Farms primarily incentivize users to provide liquidity for preferred DeFi projects. Users stake their liquidity provider tokens in a Yield Farm and earn CPT utility tokens in return.

Liquidity is vital to the DeFi platform's health. Increased liquidity on CrestSwap facilitates trading for users across numerous tokens with minimal fees. Thus, encouraging liquidity for popular trading pairs benefits everyone, as they demand more liquidity and generate higher trading fee revenue.

### Yield Farm APR:

Yield Farm Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) are influenced by three main factors: the price of the input LP token, the price of the reward token (CPT), and the quantity of input LP tokens in the pool. Let's explore how changes in these factors impact the APR of a Yield Farm:

* If the price of the input LP token rises, the APR decreases because each input LP token represents relatively fewer reward tokens.
* Conversely, if the price of the input token declines, the APR increases as each input LP token represents relatively more reward tokens.
* An increase in the price of the reward token (CPT) raises the APR, as the total value of reward tokens received for the same number of input LP tokens increases.
* Conversely, a decrease in the price of the reward token (CPT) reduces the APR, as the total value of reward tokens received for the same number of input LP tokens decreases.
* When the number of input LP tokens staked in a Yield Farm rises, the APR declines because the same quantity of reward tokens is distributed across more input LP tokens.
* Conversely, when the number of input LP tokens staked in a Yield Farm decreases, the APR increases as the same quantity of reward tokens is distributed across fewer input LP tokens.

### Benefits of Yield Farming:

Yield Farming presents an opportunity to earn additional rewards like Trading Fees or Tokens. It enhances the capital efficiency of your assets by utilizing idle tokens held in your wallet. Participating in Yield Farming supports the DeFi Ecosystem in which you're engaged.
