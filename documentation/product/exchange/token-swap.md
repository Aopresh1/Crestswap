# Token Swap

A decentralized exchange facilitates the exchange of one token for another. With thousands of cryptocurrencies available on the Zetachain blockchain, CrestSwap Dex enables users to explore and trade them effortlessly with just a single click, ensuring fast transaction execution.

For trading to occur on the Decentralized Exchange, liquidity is essential. Liquidity is provided by Liquidity Providers (LPs), who stake their tokens in pools. In return, they receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can be further staked to earn CPT tokens in the farm.

When conducting a token swap (trade) on the exchange, a 0.31% trading fee is applied, distributed as follows:

* 0.20%: Paid to liquidity pools as a trading fee for liquidity providers.
* 0.06%: Directed to the CrestSwap Treasury.
* 0.05%: Allocated towards CPT buyback and burn initiatives.
