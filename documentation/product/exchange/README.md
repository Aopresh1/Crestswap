# üîÅ Exchange

### Swapping/Trading

CrestSwap empowers users to trade directly without relying on a Centralized Exchange. Every transaction on CrestSwap is conducted directly through your own wallet, eliminating the need to entrust your coins to a third party.

### Liquidity Pools

On CrestSwap, token swapping is contingent upon the presence of sufficient liquidity for the respective tokens. If there's a scarcity of liquidity for the tokens you wish to swap, the process may become challenging, costly, or even infeasible. By supplying liquidity, you receive LP Tokens, entitling you to rewards in the form of trading fees. This ensures a consistent liquidity pool for the exchange to facilitate smooth transactions.

## Yield Farming

Yield farming enables liquidity providers to earn CPT rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. This incentive helps offset the risk of impermanent loss associated with locking liquidity.
