## What are Crest Pools?

Crest Pools offer the simplest method to earn free tokens on CrestSwap. Stake CPT and earn free tokens‚Äîit's that straightforward.

Crest Staking Pools enable users to stake their Crest Protocol (CPT) tokens to earn Crest Protocol (CPT) tokens or tokens from partner projects. These pools aid partners in fostering adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to CPT token holders.

Staking Pools:

Staking Pools allow users to stake the CPT utility tokens they've acquired, converted, or earned through yield farming to earn more CPT or tokens from partner projects. Each Staking Pool comprises an input token and a reward token. In every Staking Pool within the Dex, the input token is CPT, while the reward tokens are either CPT or a token from a CrestSwap partner project.

### Key points regarding CrestSwap Staking Pools:

* Users can stake any desired quantity of CPT tokens.
* You can unstake a portion or all of your tokens whenever you wish.
* Rewards are accumulated per block.
* Rewards are not automatically compounded back into the Staking Pool.
* You can harvest rewards at any time or reinvest them in the staking pool to increase your returns.

### Earning Rewards:

On the Staking Pools page, you'll find an APR displayed next to each pool. This indicates the amount of reward tokens accruing while your input tokens are staked, expressed as a percentage of the staked input tokens, calculated at current rates. Clicking on the calculator icon above the APR provides a new window showing the current rate of return based on the duration you plan to stake CPT in that pool.



{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware: APRs fluctuate continuously due to variations in token price, pool size, and other factors. The APRs listed and the calculators merely offer a real-time snapshot of these factors and may change on a daily basis. They do not incorporate the effects of compounding (re-staking earned reward tokens as input tokens).
{% endhint %}

If all other variables remain constant, staking more input tokens into a pool and/or prolonging the duration of the stake can potentially increase the amount of reward tokens you earn.

### Reward Harvesting:

Users have the option to harvest reward tokens from a Staking Pool at any time through one of two methods. Stakeholders can either withdraw them to their wallet or reinvest them into the Staking Pool.

By selecting "Harvest," the earned tokens will be transferred back to your wallet without being restaked into the pool. The staked balance will persist within the smart contract.
