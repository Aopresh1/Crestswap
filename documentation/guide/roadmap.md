# Roadmap

## PHASE 1

During this initial phase, our primary focus lies in constructing and launching the Dex on the mainnet. This encompasses various tasks such as token distribution (including Airdrops and Token Sales), deploying farms and pools (with the initial setup for CPT/ZETA farms and a pool for CPT tokens), establishing partnerships for bridging, and integrating extensive ecosystem token support.



## PHASE 2

During the second phase, our focus shifts to establishing the Crest Protocol Treasury, ensuring it has all the initial funds required (primarily CPT and ZETA), with the address being publicly accessible for verification purposes. Additionally, we'll be setting up additional revenue streams for the Crest Protocol Treasury, fostering partnerships with ecosystem projects, and organizing AMAs and community events.



## PHASE 3

In the third phase, Crest Protocol will commence development on both the Lottery and NFT Marketplace simultaneously, allocating resources evenly to facilitate the progress of each feature. Weekly development updates will be provided to keep stakeholders informed of the ongoing advancements.



## PHASE 4

During the Fourth phase, Crest Protocol will unveil additional features, including Voting, Info analytics for CrestSwap, and various others.
